# i3-formula
This project manages the i3 config file so that the window manager can easily be configured from a central location. It can parse bindsym statements, exec statements, one resize mode, and i3bar configuration. See pillar.example for how to setup your pillar.

This formula is currently working on an Arch Linux system. No provision has yet been made to make it work with other distributions.
